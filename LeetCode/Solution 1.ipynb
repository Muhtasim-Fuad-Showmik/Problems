    "# Problem: Remove Element\n",
    "\n",
    "[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` **in-place**. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.\n",
    "- Return `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom Judge:\n",
    "\n",
    "The judge will test your solution with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int[] nums = [...]; // Input array\n",
    "int val = ...; // Value to remove\n",
    "int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.\n",
    "                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.\n",
    "\n",
    "int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "assert k == expectedNums.length;\n",
    "sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {\n",
    "    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3`\\\n",
    "**Output:** `2, nums = [2,2,_,_]`\\\n",
    "**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.\\\n",
    "It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2`\\\n",
    "**Output:** `5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]`\\\n",
    "**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.\\\n",
    "Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.\\\n",
    "It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n",

    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition 1 (Failed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the solution is to iterate through the list of `nums` and skip any occurence of the value `val` by having them replaced by the nearest next valid number and returning the number of valid members in the list by subtracting `skipped` from the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate through the list of `nums`.\n",
    "2. For any occurence found of the value `val` keep incrementing the value of `skipped` until a valid value can be reached.\n",
    "3. If a valid value is found at the index `skipped` steps forward, replace value at current index by the valid value.\n",
    "4. By the end of the iteration, all valid values will have shifted to the left with the last `skipped` number of values remaining untouched (as they don't matter anyway).\n",
    "5. Return the number of valid values by subtracting `skipped` from `n` _(the length of the list `nums`)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity: $ O(n) $\n",
    "- Space complexity: $ O(1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause of Rejection\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolating the valid values by addition of `skipped` with current index fails for several test cases of different types of edge cases. Conditionally handling each case introduces **complexity** and **poor readability**, hence continuation of this approach unworthy of the effort.\n",
