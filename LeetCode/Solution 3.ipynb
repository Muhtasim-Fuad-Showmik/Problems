    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition (Accepted)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the problem comes from retrieving all records from the table `Customers` with the table `Orders` left joined on to it, and then filtering out the data from the joined table by displaying only the records that have _undefined_ records joined from the `Orders` table that would appear as `NULL` in the joined table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection** for the solution includes the following fields (as demonstrated in the provided example):\n",
    "- `Customers` -> `name` _renamed as_ `Customers`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data source** for the selection of data would be the `Customers` table with the `Orders` table left joined into it on the following condition:\n",
    "- $ Orders.customerId = Customers.id $ from the defined association between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions** to meet for the selection has to be:\n",
    "- `Orders.customerId IS NULL` as we only want **customers** who never order, and therefore have _no orders_, meaning on a left join their **Orders** fields would appear as `NULL`.\n",
