    "The solution to the problem comes from retrieving all records from the table `World` that meet either of the two specified conditions:\n",

    "- poplutaion of at least twenty five million\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection** for the solution includes the following fields (as demonstrated in the provided example):\n",
    "- name\n",
    "- population\n",
    "- area\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data source** for the selection of data would be the only table provided, called `World`.\n",

    "**Conditions** to meet for the selection has to be:\n",

    "- $ population >= 25000000 $ for the specified condition in the problem, \"it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., `25000000`)\"\n",

    "As described in the problem, only one of the two aforementioned conditions need to be satisfied for a country to be labelled as a big country. Therefore the conditions are combined using the `OR` operator.\n",
